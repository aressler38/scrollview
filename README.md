# scrollview


This is a scrollview that recycles its DOM elements.
It's written in ECMAScript 2015.
It's primary purpose is to enable infinite scrolling for touch interfaces.

Currently only supports infinite scrolling in the y-axis.


# TODO

1. scrollview.dataset needs to have the 1st element be an empty div for a buffer; handle this internally
1. Tweak momentum scrolling
1. Accelerated momentum scrolling (swipeswipeswipe...)
1. Mouse/keyboard controlls
1. See todos in js code...
1. Scroll bar (mostly as a positional indicator)
1. device rotation event handling
1. x-axis scrolling
1. Hook up Babel for language support.
